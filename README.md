EDA using basic data functions with Python

Overview

In this notebook, we will use pandas to examine 2018 lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Then, we will calculate the total number of strikes for each month and plot this information on a bar graph.

Import packages and libraries

Before getting started, we will need to import all the required libraries and extensions. Throughout the course, we will be using pandas, numpy, and datetime for operations, and matplotlib, pyplot, and seaborn for plotting.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
